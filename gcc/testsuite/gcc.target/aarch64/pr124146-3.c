/* The AAPCS64 passes scalars and vectors using their natural alignment,
   ignoring user alignment.  A 16-byte __int128 must therefore use its
   natural 16-byte alignment (so the C.8 rule rounds NGRN up to an even
   register), even when a may_alias typedef records a different user
   alignment.  These checks would have ICEd before the PR124146 fix.  */
