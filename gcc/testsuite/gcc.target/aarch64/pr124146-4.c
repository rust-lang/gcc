/* Like pr124146-3.c, but for _BitInt.  A _BitInt typedef that combines an
   alignment attribute with may_alias is its own TYPE_MAIN_VARIANT and keeps
   TYPE_USER_ALIGN set, which used to trip the assert in
   aarch64_function_arg_alignment (PR124146).  The AAPCS64 passes a _BitInt
   using the natural alignment of its container, ignoring user alignment: a
   _BitInt no wider than 64 bits occupies a single GPR, one between 65 and 128
   bits uses a 16-byte two-GPR container (so the C.8 rule rounds NGRN up to an
   even register), and one wider than 128 bits is passed by reference.  */
